# Modified-Unet
Three Modified UNETs for Mitochondrial Instance Segmentation
To reproduce our reported results for each modified UNET, run the main script. Plots of training and validation loss vs. training iterations, as well as training and validation Jaccard Index vs. training iterations, will automatically be saved to your current working directory as .png's. Sample segmentation predictions as well as a log of model evolution with training time are also output.
